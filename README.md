# Data Pipeline with Python and PostgreSQL
**Self-learning Project**

## Overview
This project demonstrates a basic data pipeline built using Python in Jupyter Notebook.  
It extracts data from CSV files, performs cleaning and transformation with Pandas,  
and loads the processed data into a PostgreSQL database.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- PostgreSQL  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- SQLAlchemy

## Project Files
- `data modeling part 3.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data extraction, transformation, and loading.  
- `data/`: Folder containing the input dataset used for testing.

## Key Learnings
- Understanding ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.  
- Working with structured data and databases.  
- Basic data validation and schema design in PostgreSQL.

## Note
The dataset used here is for learning purposes only.  
No confidential or private data is included.
