# Data-Pipeline-with-Python-and-PostgreSQL-Self-learning-Project-
This project builds a Python-based data pipeline with PostgreSQL. It connects to a PostgreSQL server, creates a fresh database, and sets up a table. The pipeline then cleans data from a CSV file (replacing placeholders with NULL) and inserts it into the table for analysis or reporting.
